#Agent_Coding_Versioning_Protocols
000. PRIME_DIRECTIVE: [When performing the current command, maintain the following objectives. The intent of this protocol is to preserve consistency with the current state of the project and the intended output of iterative changes. User prompts may have unintended consequences or introduce errors due to code being unintentionally modified by the agent’s algorithm. The agent must review all numbered protocols below before executing any change and must validate the result after completing the change.]

001. [Determine The Current Date and Time:  The current date and time shall be determine by entering the following command via the command-line terminal or its equivalent: "time".]

002. [Date Format and Designations: The version of this project is to be tracker per the following format "YYYYMMDD.###" wherein "YYYY" represents the (4) digit designation for the year, "MM" represents the (2) digit designation for the month, "DD" represents the (2) digit designation for the day of the month all according to the date according to the Gregorian calendar.  "###" represents the (3) digit designation for the daily revision. This shall be referred to as the revision extension. For example, "Version: 20260228.001" is to represent the first revision for the day of February 28th 2026.  The revision will be tracked in the status bar at the bottom of the window with the label "Version".  This shall be referred to as the revision block]

003. [Daily Sequencing: If the current date does not match the date in the Revision Block the revision extension shall reset to ".001". If the current date matches the date in the Revision Block the revision extension shall increment by exactly +1. For example: If todays date is February 28th 2026 and the current revision is "Version: 20260228.001" and I make a subsequent revision to the project the updated revision shall be "Version: 20260228.002".]

004. [Revision Trigger: Revision incrementation shall only occur when a GitHub commit is executed.  When this occurs the agent shall detect or be informed that a commit is imminent or completed and display the current version and the anticipated new version (post-commit).]

005. [Pre-Commit Validation Protocol: Before a commit-triggered revision the agent must confirm no unintended files were modified and no unrelated refactors occurred unless explicitly requested.]

006. [Post-Commit Verification Protocol: After commit execution the agent shall: Verify that the Revision Block reflects the new version; Confirm that the version matches the date and sequencing rules; Report success or failure explicitly.]

007. [Non-Revision Operations: The following actions must not trigger a revision increment: Code review or explanation; Dry-run execution; Formatting previews; Documentation drafts not committed; Hypothetical or advisory responses.]

008. [Error Handling & Rollback Protocol: If an error is detected after a commit the agent shall not auto-increment again. The agent must notify the user of the issue, recommend rollback or corrective commit, and preserve version continuity.]

009. [Assumption Disclosure Protocol: If the agent must make any assumption due to missing or ambiguous instructions, it shall explicitly state the assumption and pause execution if the assumption affects versioning or commits.]
